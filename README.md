#  HumHub-Theme-TodGmbH

I did a lot of changes and fixed a lot of issues and bugs. 
Theme is working nice with latest HumHub release! Version 1.0.1+

**NOT compatible with latest version of HumHub 1.2.0 beta 2!!! The theme has to be updated first.**

**NOTE**:
I`ll not do the update to HH 1.2.0 beta 2 because its a lot of work and I`m not very good with working with **less** files. I know CSS3 and HTML5 very well and a little JS but thats it - I`m only a hobby developer not a professional. If you want use my theme in future releases of HumHub then please help to do the update - otherwise the TodGmbH theme is a dead project now. Here you can find the update steps: http://docs.humhub.org/theme-theming-migrate.html

!!Your help is urgently wanted!! Thank you :)


**NOTE:** 
_The theme needs one Space which is open also for guests, otherwise the login/registration is not working! I will not change that feature, because thats the way my theme has to work, but you are welcome to edit it in your installation to fit your needs._
