#  HumHub-Theme-TodGmbH

I did a lot of changes and fixed a lot of issues and bugs. 
Theme is working nice with latest HumHub release! Version 1.0.1+

**NOT compatible with latest version of HumHub 1.2.0 !!! The theme has to be updated first.**

**NOTE**:

**I will no longer make use of HumHub and I stop updating my modules and themes for HumHub. If You want update the theme you can find the stepps here: http://docs.humhub.org/theme-theming-migrate.html**

I say Thank you and whish all HumHub users a good time:)


**NOTE:** 
_The theme needs one Space which is open also for guests, otherwise the login/registration is not working! I will not change that feature, because thats the way my theme has to work, but you are welcome to edit it in your installation to fit your needs._
