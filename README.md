#  HumHub-Theme-TodGmbH

I did a lot of changes and fixed a lot of issues and bugs. 
Theme is working nice with latest HumHub release! Version 1.0.1+

!!Your help is urgently wanted to fix some of the few little bugs which are maybe left.


**NOTE:** 
_The theme needs one Space which is open also for guests, otherwise the login/registration is not working! I will not change that feature, because thats the way my theme has to work, but you are welcome to edit it in your installation to fit your needs._

**SPECIAL**: My TodGmbH theme has now Markdown support in all Space messages and also comments. I can understand the performance implications of doing this on the server side. However, **there aren't any of those concerns** if we process the Markdown on the client side, so all is fine. 

**You should use only the following Markdown tags:**

- list style: `- your text here, or + your text here, or 1. your text here` 
- bold text: `two asterisks then your text and again two asterisks`
- italic text: `*one asterisks* or _underscores_`
- titles (H3,H4): `### Your H3 title, or #### Your H4 title `
- horizontal rules: `three underscores ___ or three asterisks ***

***




####Important Note 

Do **not use** other Markdown tags as the ones which I have named, otherwise the website **stops loading**!!!
